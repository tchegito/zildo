# The Land of Alembrume

Tribute to old-fashioned game (especially Legend of Zelda : A link to the past), where a hero has a sword and a shield to save a captured princess, by visiting many castles.

This is OpenGL-based game. It can run on Android, and any computer which can run Java6. (it's not exactly true today, see [this](https://github.com/tchegito/zildo/blob/wiki/Multiplatform.md)).

By now, it's in progress. The entire team is devoted to Alembrume's success. And sometimes, accomplish their personal life's duty, but this is occasional.
