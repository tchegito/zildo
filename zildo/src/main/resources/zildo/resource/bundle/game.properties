voleurs.chat.rouge2=You're probably right.
voleurs.chat.vert2=Don't worry, we'll pick him up in a few days, once he's realized that our Camp is not a friendly place to be.
voleurs.chat.rouge3=Fair enough. I just don't want people to think that we are murderers.

voleursm4.falcor3=And he dares enter our camp in the middle of the night!
voleursm4.zildo2=I wouldn't have done it if the Princess hadn't been kidnapped...
voleursm4.falcor4=The Princess? You mean, Roxy? She has been kidnapped?
voleursm4.zildo3=Yes, by black guards. And King Trion's Scepter has been stolen too.
voleursm4.falcor5=What? The King doesn't have his Scepter anymore? And the Princess...
voleursm4.falcor6=And who stole the Scepter?
voleursm4.zildo4=A vulture came out of nowhere and took it. I don't think he was sent by the black guards.
voleursm4.falcor7=Hmm...a vulture. As far as I know, those creatures only exist in the Desert of Valori. You must go there.
voleursm4.zildo5=Ah? Hem...Thank you sir.
voleursm4.falcor8=You can call me Falcor.
voleursm4.falcor9=Follow me, lad.
voleursm4.falcor10=So, lad who wants to save the Princess, what is your name?
voleursm4.zildo6=My name is {0}.
voleursm4.falcor11=If you're serious, come back to me when you have a Sword worthy of the name. Under our Camp, there is a fierce creature I will have you defeat.#2
voleursm4.falcor12=Aha! Well, you must leave our Camp at once, {0}. And don't get caught in the brambles on your way out.

voleursm4.falcor13=So you want to defeat the dragon? Be very careful, because your sword won't be enough!

chc2.king.6=I will be sure Maltus is doing everything he can to save my daughter, and I order you to find the Scepter.

chc2.king.8=Without it, I fear the worst. Nature will become enraged, and disasters will be unpredictable. You can't imagine how bad this situation will become, young {0}!

igorv4.boris.3=Oh you're sent here by Igor? He's locked in jail? I could provide you with Dynamite to get him out of this mess.@
igorv4.boris.4=Unfortunately, I can't make any at the moment, because I'm lacking Sawdust. Could you bring me a Bag full of it, young boy?#4
igorv4.boris.5=Great, you found a Bag, but it's empty! Maybe the woodcutters east of Lugdunia could help you.#5
igorv4.boris.6=Well done {0}! With this big Bag of Sawdust, I can make a lot of Dynamite. Thanks.

pext.scr.zildo.0=But why did they let me in?
pext.scr.hector.5=You're a young boy, so to them, you are harmless.
pext.scr.hector.6=But when they regain their strength, they will take control of all of Aldoran!
pext.scr.zildo.1=How can I stop them? My Sword can't hurt these black guards!
pext.scr.hector.7=Maybe there is a way you could improve it?
pext.scr.hector.8=Anyways, I must remain hidden. Meet me later at the library, after you find the King.

prison.gard2.1=Alright, you can go in.
prison.gard2.2=Ah sorry! Come back when you have enough money.#0
prison.gard2.3=If you want to see a prisoner, ask the guard inside.
prison.gard2.4=Your grandfather was incredibly angry last night! He was nearly out of control!
prison.igor.0=Don't worry, I'm not a bandit, you have nothing to fear from me.@
prison.igor.1=I'm Igor, the blacksmith of the Fishing Village. It isn't really a safe place for a young boy right now.@
prison.igor.2=Burglars kept stealing our fish, so I ended up blowing out the bridge to our island with Dynamite!@
prison.igor.3=The guards caught me right after the explosion. My mistake, since I'm not used to this kind of business! I'm just a simple blacksmith!
prison.igor.4=If you found some Dynamite, you could set me free.@
prison.igor.5=Just take a quick look at this wall behind me. I've been here for a week, and I've made slow progress digging with my spoon.@
prison.igor.6=With some Dynamite, you could blast the wall from the other side.@
prison.igor.7=In return, I could enhance your Sword. It's looking a little rusty.
prison.igor.8=You can visit my Village, East of the Lugdunia woodcutters forest. Unfortunately, you will have to find a way to cross the river!#7
prison.igor.9=Let's go {0}!

prison.gp.0=Oh my dear, {0}! Here you are! What a pity you must see me in here...@
prison.gp.1=I couldn't bear that my little granddaughter had been kidnapped. So since you hadn't returned, I went to the Castle and asked to see the King.@
prison.gp.2=But the guards seemed to think I was too spirited, and locked me down here for public disturbance.
prison.gp.3=I don't know how long they will keep me here, but the guards no longer like me at all. There is no kindness left in their eyes.@
prison.gp.4=Enough, don't worry about an old timer like me! {0}, I beg you, just find my little Roxy!
prison.gp.5=And if you're ever stuck, know that the Flute you're carrying has powers; she can speak to Nature in Alembrume.@

prison3.elma.1=I don't know what you're doing here, but if you're looking for fresh products, the cellar is at the end of the corridor, downstairs.@
prison3.elma.2=We had to build a wall because we were getting swarmed by rats! Be careful if you go in there.#2
prison3.elma.3=Oh you're escorting a prisoner? Is that an escape?
prison3.elma.4=Don't worry, I wouldn't say anything! I'm sure you work for a good cause.
prison3.elma.5=Will you save me too? I get bored in this kitchen.

prisonext.freeIgor.zildo.0=Outside, at last!
prisonext.freeIgor.igor.1=Thank you so much {0}!
prisonext.freeIgor.zildo.1=But we are still not off the hook!

d4m2.hector.0={0}, at last! So what did you find?
d4m2.zildo.0=Unfortunately, I haven't found our King. But there's a locked door that I couldn't access.
d4m2.hector.1=He's most likely in there. And probably a black guard nearby holds the key.
d4m2.hector.2=We have to find a way to defeat them.
## Hypothese 1
d4m2.zildo.1=I may have a solution.
d4m2.hector.3=Speak, {0}, we're listening carefully.
d4m2.zildo.2=There's a blacksmith in jail, named Igor. He said he could enhance my Sword to make it efficient against black guards.
d4m2.hector.4=Very good. As weird as it sounds for us, we have to get him out of the jail.
d4m2.anselme.0=This boy's suggestion sounds really promising.
## Hypothese 1-a
d4m2.zildo.3=I've done it, the blacksmith is out! He's waiting for us outside of the jail.
d4m2.hector.5=Amazing! We'll bring him back through the secret passage.
d4m2.hector.6=Follow me {0}.
## Hypothese 1-b
d4m2.zildo.4=But how can we get him out of there?
d4m2.hector.7=Unfortunately, you're the only one of us allowed inside the jail, without alerting the black guards.
d4m2.anselme.1=It seems to me that an inventor on the Fishermen Islands can blast through a wall, even a thick one.
## Hypothese 1-b-1 (si Zildo n'est jamais allé au village)
d4m2.zildo.5=It might be what we need. Where is this place?
d4m2.anselme.2=East of the woodcutters forest.
d4m2.zildo.6=Thanks. I'm on my way to meet this inventor.
## Hypothese 2
d4m2.zildo.7=Maybe I should go back to visit the jail.
d4m2.hector.8=Yes {0}, our King is probably locked in there, and you may find interesting secrets.
d4m2.zildo.8=Very well. I'm on my way.

lugduniag.hector.0=Follow me, this passage leads towards the Castle district.
lugduniag.hector.1=You know, {0}, this cave was dug during the War of the Two Kingdoms, when Farabrume took possession of our Castle.
lugduniag.hector.2=It allowed us to bring our few remaining troops in during the night. And in the early morning, with the element of surprise, we freed the town.
lugduniag.hector.3=Apparently, black guards don't know about this passage because no one has looked for it.
lugduniag.hector.4=Here we are.
lugduniag.hector.5=At the top of this ladder, you'll be in front of the prison, at the place we met earlier.
lugduniag.hector.6=Go get the blacksmith and come back quickly, {0}.
lugduniag.zildo.0=Alright.

lugduniag.static.hector.0=Hurry up and rescue the blacksmith!
lugduniag.static.hector.1=Time is short, {0}!#0

pext.rescue.zildo.0=Yes, follow me quickly. There's a passage right there.
pext.rescue.igor.1=Nice! Let's get out of here.

ep2.ending.0={0} and Hector have freed Igor and brought him to Lugdunia Village, safe and sound.
ep2.ending.1=Of course, they took him to a blacksmith shop.
ep2.ending.2=Igor heated up the forge and enhanced {0}'s sword.
ep2.ending.3=Now, black guards won't be unbeatable. It's time for the new Lugdunia Hero to stand against these foes.
ep2.ending.4=More than ever, the Kingdom's fate lies in the hands of {0}.
#music 'voleurs' is played from here and during the credits

ep3.beginning.0=However, we haven't seen much of a certain character during the second episode, even though she's a major one.
ep3.beginning.1=Of course, we're talking about Princess Roxy! What happened to her since she was turned into a squirrel?
ep3.beginning.2=She spent the whole night in the Oaks Forest. But let's see what she did.

sousbois.isidore.0=Hep!
sousbois.isidore.1=I go by the name of Isidore. I've never seen you before! Who are you?
sousbois.roxy.0=Indeed, you've never seen me. I'm not a real squirrel.
sousbois.isidore.2=???
## pause
sousbois.isidore.3=You know, you have to believe in yourself. We are small animals, but we are not so bad.
sousbois.roxy.1=That's not what I meant! Yesterday I wasn't a squirrel. I have been transformed by magic.
sousbois.isidore.4=Is that so? Someone turned you into a squirrel? And what were you before? Rat, or earthworm? You got lucky!
sousbois.roxy.2=Not at all! I was a princess, daughter of the King Trion in Lugdunia.
sousbois.isidore.5=You know, I'm not familiar with humans...
sousbois.roxy.3=And I'm still a princess. I have to get back my human body. Do you know how this can be done?
sousbois.isidore.6=Alas...I'm not a magic rabbit.
## pause
sousbois.isidore.7=But I've got an idea!
sousbois.roxy.4=Please tell me!
sousbois.isidore.8=Maybe you can find an Ancient Spirit at the Palace of Nature. He may help you recover you human body.
sousbois.roxy.5=Palace of Nature? A Spirit, you say? I know the land here, but I never heard of such thing.
sousbois.isidore.9=It's a very old, sacred place, built hundreds of moons ago by a forgotten people.
sousbois.isidore.10=Those we call Ancient Spirits have always been wandering around the Palace, protecting the surrounding Nature.
sousbois.roxy.6=Are they dangerous, these Spirits?
sousbois.isidore.11=Them? Not at all! They are benevolent. On the contrary, inside the Palace there are traps everywhere.
sousbois.roxy.7=Very well, I will go there. That is my only lead. Thank you Isidore for your help.
sousbois.isidore.12=You're welcome, princess!
## quand elle s'éloigne
sousbois.roxy.8=He's nice, but a bit chatty!

sousbois4.roxy.meet.0=I can see glimmers in some of the bushes around here. They look like fireflies!
sousbois4.roxy.meet.1=I should take a closer look.

sousbois4.roxy.scene.0=Oh! These walls have fallen into ruin. This must be the sacred place Isidore told me about.
sousbois4.roxy.scene.1=I should try to reach it and find these Spirits.

sousbois4.roxy.0=It looks like a firefly...
sousbois4.roxy.1=Maybe that firefly can talk too?
sousbois4.roxy.2=I'm sure you're not a firefly?

sousbois4.e1.0=A firefly? I am Arsinoe, oldest scholar of the Nature Spirits.#0
sousbois4.e1.1=You request help in your quest? Let us hear what Porphyre says about this. He wouldn't allow anyone in the Palace.
sousbois4.e2.0=If you want, rodent. Call me Archibald, the wisest of the Nature Spirits.#0

sousbois4.e2.1=That wasn't hard to find me, young creature. I'm going to explain to you how to access the Palace of Nature, so listen carefully.@
sousbois4.e2.2=Follow the will-o-wisp with your eyes two times. Then jump once again.
sousbois4.e2.3=Good luck!
sousbois4.e2.4=Do you want me to repeat how to access the Palace of Nature? #2
sousbois4.e3.0=Beg your pardon? Me, Crystallion, bravest of the Nature Spirits, you call me a firefly?
sousbois4.e4.0=Not at all! Call me Porphyre, the toughest of the Nature Spirits.#0
sousbois4.e4.1=I will allow you in the Palace. But only one of us knows how to enter.@
sousbois4.e4.2=His name starts with an A and ends with a D.#1
sousbois4.e5.0=Don't worry, your ignorance is natural. I'm Neptune, the most cosmic of all Nature Spirits.
sousbois4.e5.1=I can see you're looking for something you have lost. You should ask the most scholarly of us if he can help.

endRoxyQuest.0=But...
endRoxyQuest.1=Where am I?
endRoxyQuest.2=At last, the Princess has found the Palace of Nature.
endRoxyQuest.3=But her troubles aren't over yet...
endRoxyQuest.4=Let's focus back on our hero, {0}, since he's becoming a warrior with a real blade.

episode3.zildo.0=We can't wait any longer, we need to get moving!
episode3.anselme.0=What a rashness, my boy!
episode3.maltus.0=But the black guards will make short work of us, {0}!
episode3.hector.0=If we rush into this, we won't get anywhere. We need a more powerful weapon. 
episode3.zildo.1=But when is it going to be ready?
episode3.maltus.1=That's the signal.
episode3.hector.1=Come in.
episode3.girl.0=Gentlemen, Igor just finished the sword. You may come pick it up.
episode3.hector.2=Excellent news. Thanks Petula.
episode3.zildo.2=We will save our King at last!
episode3.hector.3=Go for it {0}. It is time, now, to attack these prison guards.
episode3.maltus.2=I'm sure they have hidden the key to access the south side of the prison.
episode3.zildo.3=Very well. I'm going now.
episode3.hector.4=Please be very careful, {0}. I set up many traps in the prison to prevent any breakout.
episode3.hector.5=Unfortunately, that will work against us.
episode3.zildo.4=Alright.
episode3.maltus.3=Good luck {0}! I...
episode3.maltus.4=I will follow you. Let's meet on the other side.
episode3.zildo.5=Hmm...Okay.

d4m9.igor.0=Hello {0}! I finished the Sword.@
d4m9.igor.1=It is still a little bit hot, but you can have it.
d4m9.igor.2=You will see, your sword is now far more powerful than your previous blade.@
d4m9.igor.3=With it, you may break through a black guard's armor.

prison16.zildo.0=But where is the King?
prison16.zildo.1=Is he really in that prison?!?

## hero saves the king. First, room with closed door. Doors open, king turns back:
prison.saveKing.zildo.0=Your Highness!
prison.saveKing.trion.0=What's happening? Who's there?
## hero comes in
prison.saveKing.trion.1=Ah young {0}! There you are!
prison.saveKing.zildo.1=Yes, your Highness. But let's get out of here. This place dishonors you.
prison.saveKing.trion.2=Good boy! Don't worry about my honor! My concern is with Lugdunia!

prison.saveKing.trion.3=Is the way cleared outside?
## Does hero clear the way out to the library (black guards in front of the castle)
prison.saveKing.zildo.a1=No, I'm afraid there are still some black guards.
prison.saveKing.trion.a4=So take care of them, and I will follow you once it is done.
prison.saveKing.zildo.a2=Alright, your Highness, I'm going to face them.
prison.saveKing.zildo.b3=Yes, I defeated all of them, your Highness.
prison.saveKing.trion.b4=Excellent, {0}. You did a good job.

prison.saveKing.trion.ill.1=Unfortunately, aaaatchooo! By now, I can't leave this bed.
prison.saveKing.trion.ill.2=Since we lost the Scepter, Nature is upside-down. And aaaatchooo!
prison.saveKing.trion.ill.3=I've got a strong hay fever. I can hardly breathe.
prison.saveKing.zildo.2=But what can I do to help, your Majesty?
prison.saveKing.trion.ill.4=I would need a potion from Eleoric, the druid living west of the castle. She can heal all diseases.
prison.saveKing.zildo.3=Very well, your Highness. But how can I find her? I don't know anybody who ever met Eleoric.
prison.saveKing.trion.ill.5=Ah! A lot of people believe she is a legend. But she really exists.
prison.saveKing.trion.ill.6=Go through the door and down the stairs, then head to the west. The druid lives in the forest nearby.
prison.saveKing.zildo.4=Alright, your Majesty! I'm going to find her right now and bring back the cure for you.

prison.saveKing.trion.ill.7=Did you bring back the cure that I need, young {0}?
prison.saveKing.zildo.5=Not yet, unfortunately, your Highness.

prison.saveKing.zildo.6=Yes, your Highness! I got it. There you are.
prison.saveKing.trion.4=Thank you, young {0}! I already feel much better.
prison.saveKing.maltus.1=Is anybody there?
prison.saveKing.maltus.2=Ah, I found you, my King! And you're here too, {0}!
prison.saveKing.trion.5=Maltus, you finally made it.
prison.saveKing.maltus.3=Ah, I believed that I was the...first one?
prison.saveKing.trion.6=You may escort me when I am okay. For now, do you have some clues to find my daughter and our Scepter?
prison.saveKing.zildo.7=The chief of the thieves told me to go to the Valori Desert. The vulture who stole the Scepter should be there.
prison.saveKing.trion.7=Desert? Unfortunately, it's closed by an ancient gate. Each King of Aldoran used to have one of the keys.
prison.saveKing.zildo.8=What? We need several keys to open this gate?
prison.saveKing.trion.8=Absolutely, {0}. There are 3 locks. In Ancient Times, each kingdom had a key.
prison.saveKing.trion.9=But in recent times, Aldoran's key lies in the belly of a beast, underground.
prison.saveKing.zildo.9=But I need it! Where can I find this beast?
prison.saveKing.trion.10=Ah! It is a fearsome dragon! It lives in the Cave of the Flames.
prison.saveKing.zildo.10=The one under the Thieves Camp? But I have already been there, and I didn't see any dragon.
prison.saveKing.maltus.4=You really have been there?
prison.saveKing.trion.11=That is quite normal, my young {0}. The area where the dragon lives was locked a long time ago. Today, I'm the only one with the key to access it.
prison.saveKing.zildo.11=Please, your Majesty. I need this key to find your Scepter!
prison.saveKing.trion.12=Fair enough, young {0}. Here it is.
prison.saveKing.trion.13=Beware of him! His reign of terror is not over yet.
prison.saveKing.trion.14=Now, Maltus, will you get me out of here?
prison.saveKing.maltus.5=Of course, my King. Let us go immediately.

prison.saveKing.zildo.12=I need to go back into the Cave of the Flames, through that hole near the Thieves Camp.
prison.saveKing.zildo.13=It's just you and me, Dragon!

eleom1.e.8=Now, we have to find these nettle leaves.@
eleom1.e.9=This is a plant growing in our forest around here, but more specifically near the Palace of Nature, to the south.@
eleom1.e.10=Bring me 50 leaves, please.#4
#Hero get enough nettles
eleom1.e.11=Congratulations {0}! We have enough nettles now.@
eleom1.e.12=Give me all of them, and I will handle this.
eleom1.e.13=Here it is! The remedy is ready for the King.
eleom1.e.14=You can have it, {0}.
eleom1.e.15=This is the remedy for the King. He must drink it in one sip, then he'll get better.
eleom1.e.16=So {0}, did you give my potion to the King?

chateausud.v.0=Well, it's not often I see new people around here!@
chateausud.v.1=This park used to be highly frequented before. But since the castle has expanded, there are not many roads leading here anymore.
chateausud.v.2=I live with my grandson in the Silver Birch Forest. But he refuses to leave since he works with that druid.@
chateausud.v.3=I'd like to regain a little bit of peace.
chateausud.v.4=If you can ever convince my grandson to leave my house and live a life, that would relieve me so much.#4
chateausud.v.5=You did it! Now my grandson talks about living with a young girl from the farm! I'm so relieved!@
chateausud.v.6=Please, check inside the barrel at my place. You'll find a little reward as a thank you.

eleom3.v.2=Sometimes, I get bored, here alone. But we're stuck, in this Silver Forest.@
eleom3.v.3=It is forbidden to enter the castle from this side. We can see the Piochais Farm, but that ledge is too high for me to jump.#2
eleom3.v.4=What? You know about a secret passage to reach the farm?@
eleom3.v.5=I'm on my way, as soon as I can. Long time since I've seen Christa.
eleom3.p.0=In the barrel, you discover some money!

ferme.v.0=There, you came at the perfect time {0}! Haven't you seen Christa? I'm looking for her.@
ferme.v.1=If you see Christa, tell her to meet me here. I'll be waiting.#1

fermem2.c.0=That boy is wandering around our farm. I think I've already seen him somewhere. But he looks weird...
fermem2.c.1=I believe I will stay here for now.#1
fermem2.c.2=Is that so? He's looking for me? But what about?
fermem2.c.3=Alright. I will meet him. Maybe he's nice.

eleom4.p.0=Hi my friend! Are you a sort of knight?
eleom4.p.1=Did you see the turtles hanging around the river? Some of them flee as soon as we are close to them.
eleom4.p.2=And some others stay if we remain silent. That's odd!
