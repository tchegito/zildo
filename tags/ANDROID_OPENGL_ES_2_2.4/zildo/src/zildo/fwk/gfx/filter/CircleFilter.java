/**
 * Draws a circle around a specific center (Zildo !).<br/>
 * 
 * Mathematical explanation:<p/>
 * 
 * Each point respecting following equation must be shown :<br/>
 * (x - a) + (y - b) > r <p/>
 * 
 * So the screen is divided vertically into 3 areas :<ol>
 * <li>before circle : all is black</li>
 * <li>circle : each line has two roots from an equation derived from the first one
 * <li>after circle : all is black again</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * In order to calculate the derived equation, let's set a variable Y = (y - b) <br/>
 * So we have: <br/>
 * (x - a) + Y > r <br/>
 * wich gives : <br/>
 * x - 2ax + a + Y - r > 0 <p/>
 * 
 * If we calculate the delta : <br/>
 * D = (-2a) - 4 * (a + Y - r) <br/>
 * D = 4 * (a - r)<p>
 * 
 * So we deduce the 2 roots of the equation : <br/>
 * x1 = (2 * a - sqrt(D)) / 2 <br/>
 * x2 = (2 * a + sqrt(D)) / 2 <br/>
