#summary Engine explanation 1 : client/server

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

= Introduction =

Here, we will briefly describe the class hierarchy, from top view, and going into the model more precisely.


= General view =

Here is the client/server separation, with more representative classes. All links mean *composition*.

Client and server don't manage the same data. Client has a basic view on everything it has to render, as server has to handle all the world. We'll see later that there's some exceptions, designed for performance issues.

== Concept ==

The general idea is that clients are just terminals, which only send basic orders to server. Like key pressed, essentially, but other events too, in order to display correctly things according to the client's speed.

On the other side, server is responsible for the general state of the world. It only sends to client what they need. For example, a client doesn't know if a given sprite is an enemy or a NPC. He doesn't know neither how much money has the Zildo he's controlling. He just have simplified informations about each rendered sprite, each tile of the current map,etc. We'll discuss the exhaustivity later.

== Data protocol ==

To communicate between server and clients, we use only UDP because we don't need all TCP security checks. We need more speed to have acceptable pings on all clients.

A mini framework exists in Zildo to handle such send/receive operations. Here is a brief representation of it, where all links mean *unheritance*:

The main class is [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/TransferObject.java TransferObject]. It's the most low-level one. It handles socket creation, channel opening, and broadcasting.

The second one, [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/NetSend.java NetSend] handles send/receive operations by encapsulating them in Packet classes. We'll see that in the next part.

And the more evoluated objects are designed for client and server purpose. They contains all precise interactions between such actors. We got a [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/InternetClient.java InternetClient] class, opposed to [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/NetClient.java NetClient], which are respectively the www client, and the LAN client.

= Packet presentation =

There is a class hierarchy, where all links mean *unheritance*.

[http://lh6.ggpht.com/_q_5wHG9LsPk/SxJ0JMhzd1I/AAAAAAAABfU/tBMZ55svWdA/packetView.PNG]

Let's see which are the goal of each packet:

 * == `ServerPacket` [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/packet/ServerPacket.java (SVN)] ==

 This packet signal that a server exists on a given IP adress. In local area network,  it's send over a given delay in order to clients can see that a server is running.
 On an internet game, it's is nonsense. Client just have to pick up the server's IP to connect to. So this packet is never used in internet game.

 * == `ConnectPacket` [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/packet/ConnectPacket.java (SVN)] ==

 Client asks server to connect into its game.

 * == `AcceptPacket` [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/packet/AcceptPacket.java (SVN)] ==

 Server sends an acknowledgement to client for him to join the game, returning to him his zildo's ID by the way.

 * == `AskPacket` [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/packet/AskPacket.java (SVN)] ==

 With this packet, a client can ask server for a given resource : map, sprite ...

 * == `GetPacket` [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/packet/GetPacket.java (SVN)] ==

 This packet contains a resource (see *!ResourceType* enum in [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/packet/AskPacket.java AskPacket] class to have the entire resource types). It can be a set of same kind of resources, or unique one.

 * == `EventPacket` [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zildo/fwk/net/packet/EventPacket.java (SVN)] ==

 It's a packet specifically sent by client, to signal a identifiable event, like a dialog end, or something else, which is relevant to client.

= Dialog =

== Connection ==

As we already said previously, there is two different behaviors between LAN and www game :

 * *LAN* : server sends repeatively a *ServerPacket* with broadcast on all IP adresses with this form x.x.x.255 where the 'x' are server's IP adress members. It means that every client with same three members is targeted.

 * *www* : server sends nothing. Client has to select the server in a list.
