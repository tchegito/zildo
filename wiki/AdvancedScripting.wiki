== Contextual actions ==

There is two kinds of context which can be assigned to an execution script:
 * sprite : referring to an actor (character) or a simple entity
 * tile : referring to a tile position

In both context, special variables are allowed:
 * *x* and *y* : coordinates of the sprite/tile, each one on his referential
 * *z* : z-coordinate (only for sprite context)
 * *attente* : value of character's 'attente' field (only for character context)
 * *self* : name of the character
 * *zildo.x* and *zildo.y* : hero's coordinates
 * *zildo.money* : hero's gold pieces amount
 * *zildo.angle.x* and *zildo.angle.y* : hero's angle coordinate (example: [0, -1] for north, [1, 0] for east)


== Local variables ==

<p>We can use local variables in scripts, defined with a name starting with "{{{loc:}}}".</p>
A local variable is visible in its own scope, and sub sets, as in any classic language. For example:
{{{
    <tileAction id="fireflies">
        <spawn what="loc:firefly" type="PURPLE_FIREFLY" pos="x*16, y*16"
               z="4" alpha="180" foreground="true" />
       	<timer each="80+random*15">
            <action>
		        <moveTo what="loc:firefly" pos="x*16+random*40,y*16+random*30" way="circular"
                        zoom="128+bell*128" unblock="true"/>
            </action>
        </timer>
    </tileAction>
}}}
Here, variable {{{loc:firefly}}} is visible everywhere inside this {{{tileAction}}} because it's defined at its top level. So inside the {{{timer}}} scope, we can access it, as we do in the {{{moveTo}}} action.

== Built-in functions ==

<p>There is several useful built-in functions which an be used in any scripts:</p>

 * *dice10* : returns a integer x as followed: 0 <= x < 10
 * *random* : returns a float f as followed: 0 <= f < 1

=== Special functions ===

In a circular {{{moveTo}}}action (see tileAction 'fireflies' just above) we can use *bell* keyword. It provides a smooth function for going from one value to another one, describing a kind of bell, with a simple sinus function.
