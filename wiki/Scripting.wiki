#summary Script language in Zildo

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />


= Model Description =

The scripting module in Zildo is divided into two essentials sections :
 * scenes
 * quests

== Main elements ==

All is described in a set of XML files, each one containing an ADVENTURE root. The division of files is only intended to separate adventure in episodes, to enhance understanding.

But let's see how works the 2 sections.

=== Scenes ===

A scene is a cinematic sequence, where player can't act. He just has to show events happening like in a movie.

Basically, it's a list of mini-actions which are launched sequentially. Some can be launched simultaneously. (see the 'Misc' section)

=== Quests ===

A quest is an objective for the player. It has 3 parts:
 * *trigger* : what the player has to do in order to accomplish the quest
 * *action* : direct actions from the accomplishment
 * *history* : consequences in the history (map replacements ...)

A quest has a name and a state during the game, which can be 'done' or 'undone'.

_Note_ : when loading a saved game, every accomplished quest launches the execution of each 'history' part, but not 'action' part.

==== Attributes ====

 * repeat : 'false' (by default) means only one execution of this quest is possible
 * locked : 'true' by default => it means that the triggering of this quest freeze the game


== Trigger & Action ==

=== Trigger ===

A trigger can be of 6 different kinds : (corresponding to [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/monde/quest/QuestEvent.java QuestEvent] )

==== Types ====

 * *location* : when a character reach a given location
   * name: map name
   * pos: location, in pixel coordinates
   * radius: radius around the point indicated by 'pos'
   * tilePos: location, in tile coordinates
   * gear: mechanism type (BUTTON, TIMED_BUTTON)
   * mover: name of a moving platform
   * tileValue: a value for a given tile (bank*256 + index)
 * *dialog* : when a specific character say a given sentence
 * *inventory* : does Zildo have a given item ?
 * *questDone* : has Zildo achieved a given quest ?
 * *dead* : does a set of creatures died ?
 * *push* : is someone pushing an element ?

==== Particular cases ====

To handle some automatic events, like "hero opens a chest", or "hero unlocks a door", we need to remember that players did it. So it's represented as a quest in the savegame.

To name such quest, we use a simple mechanism:
<code><mapName><location></code>

For example, the following is the name of a quest happening on map "voleursm2u" at location (4,3) :
<code>"voleursm2u(4, 3)"</code>

It means that we can run actions when this particular event is triggered, just with declaring such quest with this name in the XML file. Then, this quest won't need any trigger. Here is the quest corresponding to the previous example:
{{{
    <quest name="voleursm2u(4, 3)">
    	<action>
    	    <speak who="zildo" text="voleurs.m2u.money"/>
    	</action>
    </quest>
}}}

=== Multithread ===

Here is some details for particular commands about multithreading actions.

Basically, each command is launched when the previous one is finished.
But, there's two possibilities to avoid this kind of mechanic.

==== actions ====

Into the command 'actions', you can add a sublist of actions. It means that each one should happen in the same time.

It's useful when two people have to walk in the same direction, or when the camera should follow a character and so on.

==== unblock ====

With the attribute 'unblock', the given command is said to be unblocking. It means that next action can start without waiting for the current one.

==== locked ====

By default, a scene is blocking all player movements, because it's a cinematic which player should see like a movie.
But sometimes, we need to execute a script without blocking the player. For example, a moving platform on which hero has to climb to reach a distant area. And for this, we have the "locked" attribute :
{{{
<quest name="vg5_but1" locked="false">
     (...)
</quest>
}}}
It means that this quest doesn't lock the player movements. He can move around during this quest is executing its actions, as if no script was going on. Basically, all scripts executed from this quest unherits the locked attribute.

=== Misc ===

==== Focusing entities ====

It's possible to focus on character, or element, with the simple command *focus*. It commands the camera to put the given element on the center of attention.

This command, by default, moves instantly the camera, by setting its position to the desired one. But you can go smoothly to it, by using the attribute _delta_. This attribute has another consequence : the action will be achieved when camera will be at its target. So the attribute _unblocking_ could be useful in such case.

A last thing to notice about focusing is that if the element moves, camera will move too. That's pretty natural for a focus feature ! But you can reset camera focusing by calling *pos* command on camera with the same postion. Here is an example :

{{{
 <focus what="caveDoor" delta="true"/>
 <focus/>
}}}

This is going to focus on an element named `caveDoor` and once camera is on it, the focus will finish. It means that camera won't move at this time, and stay at its current position. But it won't follow any movement anymore of this element.

==== Sub-execution ====

A script can execute another one. To handle this and the priorities rules coming from this, this is how it works :
 * a queue is storing all executing scripts
 * when a new one is launched, it goes on the top of the queue
 * as long as the first script isn't finished, the second won't run

There's an exception to this priority rules, driven by the "mapscripts". They need to be ran before all, in order to get a correct aspect for the current map. So they have a "top priority" flag, to avoid another script launched before.


= Class modelization =

Here is a class model representation :

[http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_0tQGqmH-aA/T2iAgkvDvmI/AAAAAAAABpI/qd8MEWq5p5I/w1420-h284-k/scriptclasses.PNG]

We can see that [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/server/state/ScriptManagement.java ScriptManagement] handle all the stuff related to script (as [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/server/PersoManagement.java PersoManagement], [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/server/MapManagement.java MapManagement] in its respective fields). It has two main linked objects :

 * *[http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/fwk/script/xml/element/AdventureElement.java AdventureElement]* : a representation of all game scripts (see quests.xml), containing the model described in the start of this document. Note that this object is dynamic, and is the mirror of the instant game situation (issued from a savegame for example). It's not a finished state.
 * *[http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/zildo/src/zildo/fwk/script/command/ScriptExecutor.java ScriptExecutor]* : an object dealing with current executing scripts (if any).
