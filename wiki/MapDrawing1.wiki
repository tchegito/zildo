#summary 12-tiled patches

= Drawing algorithm : 12-tiled patches =

In ZEditor, in order to draw roads, forest border, ... we use a simple algorithm called here 12-tiled patches. So user can drag his mouse on the map, and a path is drawn magically.

Basically, we have a set of tiles (12 to draw a shape) describing all possibilities with a square divided into 4 sub-squares.


== Binary view ==

Let's take a simple square, and cut it twice on the middle of each side.
Then we assign a power of 2 in each region to get this :

|| 8 || 4 ||
|| 2 || 1 ||

This is sized like a tile in the game, and valued with the sum of each region. 
Now we must think about something to draw, a path for example. We assume that a tile without any piece of path is 0-valued, and another with full path is 15-valued.

How much different values have we ? In ZEditor, only 12 values :
 * outside corners : 1, 2, 4, 8
 * straight : 12, 5, 3, 10
 * inside corners : 11, 13, 14, 7
Plus simple ones : 
 * empty : 0
 * full : 15

Note that diagonal values are excluded : 6, 9.

== Graphical view ==

Let's take the forest border example.

We have outside corners on the left, and inside ones on the right.

== Java algorithm ==

There is an abstract class called [http://code.google.com/p/zildo/source/browse/trunk/src/zeditor/core/prefetch/complex/AbstractPatch12.java AbstractPatch12] which deals of this kind of technic.

All we have to do is provide two methods in a derived class :
 # toBinaryValue
 # toGraphicalValue

The first one gets a tile value from the map and returns the binary view.

The second one does the opposite, returning the tile value to put it on the map.
